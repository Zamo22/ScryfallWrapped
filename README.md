# ScryfallWrapped

**Disclaimer: This package is in no way endorsed by ScryfallÂ© or Wizards of the Coast.**

This is temporary description whilst this package is in progress:
The intention of this package is to create a comprehensive wrapper around the Scryfall API that simplifies using the API in native Swift.

The ideal scenario is to eventually have all Scryfall APIs represented in some but this is highly dependent on time constraints and what is actually relevant and useful for what I would personally like to use the API for.

Part of the goal of this project is to familiarise myself with Swift Package Manager and creating distributable packages.
As always, contribution or simply comments/feedback is highly appreciated.
